#### Powering Columnar In-Memory Analytics

Arrow is a set of technologies that enable big-data systems to process and move data fast.

Initial implementations include:

 - [The Arrow Format](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/format)
 - [Arrow Structures and APIs in C++](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp)
 - [Arrow Structures and APIs in Java](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/java)

Arrow is an [Apache Software Foundation](www.apache.org) project. More info can be found at [arrow.apache.org](http://arrow.apache.org).

#### Getting involved

Right now the primary audience for Apache Arrow are the designers and
developers of data systems; most people will use Apache Arrow indirectly
through systems that use it for internal data handling and interoperating with
other Arrow-enabled systems.

Even if you do not plan to contribute to Apache Arrow itself or Arrow
integrations in other projects, we'd be happy to have you involved:

- Join the mailing list: send an email to
  [dev-subscribe@arrow.apache.org][1]. Share your ideas and use cases for the
  project.
- [Follow our activity on JIRA][3]
- [Learn the format][2]
- Contribute code to one of the reference implementations
